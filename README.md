## **Project Overview**

This project is a web application that provides fun ways to learn about ocean life through interactive photos, videos, and games. It also makes it easy for users to access any other websites about ocean conservation in one place. It is comprised of the website and a 2D game called: The Great Ocean Clean Up.

## **Project Goal**

The lack of conservation and protection of our world’s ocean environments has been contributing to issues such as climate change, among many others. The goal of this project is to spread knowledge about ocean life and ocean conservation among its users in fun and interactive ways.

## **Problems it Tries to Solve**

The lack of conservation and protection of our world’s ocean environments has been contributing to issues such as climate change, but in order to help, who wants to browse the internet to read through a bunch of hefty articles or find which organizations are actually helping?

Here is where Under the Sea solves that problem. It provides an interactive web experience to learn about ocean life. It lists ocean conservation organizations and summaries of their main goals, to make it easier than ever to make a difference quickly.

## **Game Overview**

Play as Stevey the penguin, as he explores the ocean floor, cleaning up trash and squashing enemies.

### **Game Objective**

Clean up the ocean by collecting as much trash as possible. Progress through as many levels as you can and achieve your highest overall score.

### **Controls**

- ### **Jump**: Space-Bar
- ### **Move Left**: Left-Arrow
- ### **Hit Enemy**: Shift-Left or Shift-Right
- ### **Special Power-Up**: Grab a falling starfish and run in both directions picking up anything in site. Picking up any trash or killing any enemies in this state is worth double the points.
- ### **Pause/Play**: Enter

### **Scoring Points**

You must score enough points to advance to the next level before the timer runs out. The timer gets shorter as the levels increase, and resets once you advance to a new level

### **There are 4 ways to accumulate points:**

1. Collect trash that falls from the top of the screen: **+ 10pts**

2. Jump on or hit enemies: **+ 5pts**

3. Grab the one falling sea turtle:**+ 30pts**

4. Collect gems or coins: **+ 5pts**

### **Advancing Levels**

### **There are two ways to advance a level:**

1. Score enough points to reach a score that is higher than the "Level Limit" score. The score to reach increases by 10 pts per level.

2. Grab the sea turtle if you see it falling, which (may) only spawn once per level during the last 40 seconds.

### **Losing Points & Taking Damage**

1. Lose 5 pts for every piece of trash that hits the ground that does not get picked up in time

2. You are provided 4 hearts for health at the start of the game. One hit is worth half a heart. If you lose all health at any time the game is over.

## **Project Technologies**

### For the 2D Game, **The Great Ocean Clean Up**, the **LOVE2D** Framework was used, a framework for making 2D games in lua.
